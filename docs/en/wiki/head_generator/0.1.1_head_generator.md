## How to create a resource pack for Head Generator

To add custom heads to Head Generator using a resource pack, there are two different ways to generate skins: using "textures" and "models".

### Textures

1. Create a normal resource pack and place the head textures in the `assets/fzmm/textures/heads` folder. The textures should be 64x16 images or larger in the PNG format, with only the first 64x16 pixels being used.

2. Use the resource pack like any other. When you go to the head generator screen, the heads will be added to the list and arranged alphabetically.

3. To find the heads more easily, you can add them to your favorites.

### Example

You can check out the resource pack [FZMM Head generator example.zip](https://github.com/Zailer43/FZMM-Mod/files/10303878/FZMM.Head.generator.example.zip) to see how it's done.

This example resource pack adds the following textures:
- Blue mask
- Ocelot mask

## Where did you get the heads that the mod currently contains

Mostly from [NameMC](https://namemc.com) and some from [Minecraft-Heads](https://minecraft-heads.com), I have cropped them and deleted the unnecessary pixels of the head
