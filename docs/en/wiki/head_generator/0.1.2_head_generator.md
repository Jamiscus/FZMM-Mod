## How to create a resource pack for Head Generator

To add custom heads to Head Generator using a resource pack, there are two different ways to generate skins: using "textures" and "models".

### Textures

1. Create a normal resource pack and place the head textures in the `assets/fzmm/textures/heads` folder. The textures should be 64x16 images or larger in the PNG format, with only the first 64x16 pixels being used.

2. Use the resource pack like any other. When you go to the head generator screen, the heads will be added to the list and arranged alphabetically.

3. To find the heads more easily, you can add them to your favorites.

#### Example

You can check out the resource pack [FZMM Head generator example.zip](https://github.com/Zailer43/FZMM-Mod/files/10303878/FZMM.Head.generator.example.zip) to see how it's done.

This example resource pack adds the following textures:
- Blue mask
- Ocelot mask

### Models

In version 0.1.2, the new way of generating skins is using "models", but the previous method of using "textures" is still available.

To add custom heads to Head Generator using models, follow these steps:

1. Create a JSON file in the following folder: `assets/fzmm/models/heads`. The JSON files support the following structure:

```json5
{
  "textures": TextureObject[],
  "steps": StepObject[]
}
```
2. Use the resource pack like any other. When you go to the head generator screen, the heads will be added to the list and arranged alphabetically.

3. To find the heads more easily, you can add them to your favorites.

#### Objects

##### TextureObject

```json5
{
  "path": String, // The path of the texture in the resource pack, for example: "fzmm:textures/model_textures/texture.png"
   "id": String // The id used to identify the texture for use
}
```

#### Possible StepObjects

##### Select texture
Selects a texture that will be used in the following steps. The default selected texture is the base skin, its id is `base_skin`

```json5
{
  "type": "select_texture",
  "texture_id": String // The id defined in textures
}
```

##### Delete
Deletes pixels from the selected area in the final texture


```json5
{
  "type": "delete",
  "area": Area // the area where the pixels will be deleted
}
```

##### Copy
Copies an area from the selected texture and places it in the final texture

```json5
{
  "type": "copy",

  "source": Area, // The area of the selected texture where the pixels will be copied

  "destination": Area, // The area of the final texture where the copied pixels will be placed,
  // this value is optional and if not specified, the same values of "source" will be used

  "add_hat_layer": boolean, // if true, it adds the first layer of the source in the destination
  // and adds the second layer of both, this value ignores "hat_layer" of source and destination,
  // this value is optional and by default is false

  "overlap_source_hat": boolean, // if true, it adds the first and second layer of the source in the destination,
  // this value ignores "hat_layer" of source and destination, this value is optional and by default is false
  
  "degrees": int, // rotates the texture when placing it in the destination but rotating it from its center,
  // this value is optional and by default is 0
  
  "mirror_horizontal": boolean, // applies a horizontal mirror to the copied texture,
  // it is applied after rotating with degrees, this value is optional and by default is false
  
  "mirror_vertical": boolean // applies a vertical mirror to the copied texture,
  // it is applied after rotating with degrees, this value is optional and by default is false
}
```

##### Area
Represents an area in a Minecraft skin model, with information about its position, size, and whether it includes the hat layer or not

```json5
{
  "offset": String, // The offset of the area
  // Possible values are "HEAD", "BODY", "RIGHT_ARM", "RIGHT_LEG", "LEFT_LEG", "LEFT_ARM"

  "hat_layer": boolean, // Whether the area is the hat layer

  "x": int, // The x coordinate of the top-left corner of the area

  "y": int, // The y coordinate of the top-left corner of the area

  "width": int, // The width of the area

  "height": int // The height of the area
}
```

#### Examples
You can find examples of the models in: https://github.com/Zailer43/FZMM-Mod/tree/09868b375e84ee86d50fedaca2dcd4e207cd077e/src/main/resources/resourcepacks/fzmm_default_heads/assets/fzmm/models/heads

## Q: Can I generate a head without internet?
A: You can't, you need to have internet to access the mineskin API and send them the skin, so they upload it to a minecraft account, and then give you the value of the skin, you also need internet to load the skin.

## Q: Can I speed up the generation of heads?
A: You can do it by associating **your google account** in [mineskin](https://mineskin.org/apikey) and entering your API Key in the mod configuration, it will make uploading skins **1-2 seconds faster**

## Q: Where did you get the heads that the mod currently contains
A: Mostly from [NameMC](https://namemc.com) and some from [Minecraft-Heads](https://minecraft-heads.com), I have cropped them and deleted the unnecessary pixels of the head
